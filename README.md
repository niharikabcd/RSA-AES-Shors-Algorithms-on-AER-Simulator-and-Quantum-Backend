# RSA-AES-Shors-Algorithms-on-AER-Simulator-and-Quantum-Backend
AES.ipynb file contains jupyter notebook code of AES Algorithm executed on CPU and GPU.
rsac1.ipynb file contains jupyter notebook code of RSA Algorithm executed on CPU and GPU.
Shors Algorithm is executed in two different files, one conatains code which executes Shors Algorithm on AER Simulator(Shors algorithm_on_simulator.ipynb)
and another file Shors_on_Quantum_Hardware.ipynb contains code which executes Shors Algorithm on Quantum Backend,we used IBM Quantum Platform for the API token for using Actual Quantum Hardware.
This code is working with the latest updates done on Qiskit Library(removal of Shor's Algorithm which used to be an in-built function).
This code only Focuses on number '15' only,as in ,it only factorises the number '15'.
